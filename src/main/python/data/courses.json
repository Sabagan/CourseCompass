One important goal of this class is for students to learn how concepts of Representation impact the architecture that we make and the architecture that we experience. It is the understanding of the \u2018why\u2019 that pertains to all aspects of architecture, both complex relationships and abstract concepts, that is of importance."

It serves the function of a capstone course, integrating much of the knowledge gained in other business courses. It is a truly different kind of course. Other courses are concerned with a narrower, more specialized body of knowledge, and as a result are highly structured. Some provide quantitative techniques while others relate to specific skills. The problems and issues of strategy management cover the whole spectrum of business. Weighing the pros and cons of strategy requires a total enterprise perspective and a talent for judging how all of the relevant facts add up. To keep the discussions down to earth, each week real companies will be examined. In addition, the course uses some experiential exercises which may include a simulation. This course is by far the most demanding course in the Business Management Degree and as such it is recommended that students have 10 or fewer courses left to graduate before enrolling in this course.

An \"investment\" problem involves making a decision to allocate financial resources to acquire productive assets that will generate cash flows in future time periods. Engineering economics seeks to develop and apply a logically consistent methodology for evaluating investment projects. Discounted cash flow methods are used in analyzing such projects. In this course we will assume certain cash flows and ignore taxation implications. After developing the mathematics of cash flow equivalence, absolute and relative measures of project worth will be developed and applied to individual and multiple projects. The emphasis will be on private project decisions, but similar methods will be applied to public sector projects."

Research and analysis will consider the philosophical, sociological and artistic concepts and references. Building upon the research phase, students will explore the body, movement, proportions, and other elements to develop new narratives that inform a design philosophy. Combining a design philosophy with conceptualization and vision, a parameter-based method is applied to articulate a creative direction. Interpretation of form, silhouette, material, and process with an expression of social and ecological responsibility drives the creation of a speculative object that can be worn. Students will develop a cohesive collection of garments expanding on the vision and concept of their speculative object."
